# Learn / Make #

This documentation provides resources to learn about the `make` software,
which is used to automate compiling software based on dependencies.
In particular, `make` is often used to compile `C`, `C++`, and `Fortran` programs,
although it is also used to automate many tasks based on dependencies.

This documentation has been written based on experience using `make` at the Open Water Foundation.
